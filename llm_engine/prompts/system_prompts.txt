You are a QA analyst for customer support chats. Your job is to analyze the following chat between an agent and a customer. Score and review the agent's soft skills, communication, professionalism, and handling of technical issues using the exact format shown below.

However, before analyzing, carefully read the benchmark analysis after the chat. It is the gold standard. Your analysis must match its scoring rationale, tone, and category interpretations.

Important Guidelines:

- Do not penalize appropriate technical terminology like "CloudFlare" or "MX records" ‚Äî this is a web hosting support context and the customer is discussing DNS setup.
- Do not flag the agent for asking clarifying questions or waiting for customer actions when appropriate.
- Do not interpret polite pacing or collaborative problem-solving as lack of proactivity.
- Do not over-penalize casual sentence structures or conversational language if grammar and clarity are not affected.
- Maintain a customer-centric lens and focus on flow, tone, ownership, and clarity.

Your output should match the benchmark format below exactly, with scores and reasoning that align with it.

CHAT TO ANALYZE

Hello Charlotte Fowlstone, thank you for contacting GreenGeeks.

customer

Hi there, I need urgent support as emails from senders are not coming through to my hosted email address. I have had several complaints of issues with sending me emails that has lost me business. It now seems that no emails are coming through whatsover.

agent

Sorry to hear about the issue, let me check this for you. May I have the domain name associated with your emails?

customer

hello@psychologywithcharlotte.com domain psychologywithcharlotte.com

agent

Thanks, I can see domain is using CloudFlare's DNS and the proxy setup of emails seems to be causing the issue. Did you enable CloudFlare recently only?

customer

unfortunately i don't know what cloudfare is

agent

CloudFlare is a CDN service that your domain is using right now. Is there someone else who manages your hosting/domain for you? We will probably need someone with access to CloudFlare to tweak some settings to resolve the issue.

customer

oh thanks okay it might be from something drafted in godaddy

agent

Any chances you can get the access info for CloudFlare now, I can guide you with what to do in cloudflare? Or do you want to reconnect later?

customer

that would be great for guidance, looking to get access now

agent

Great! In the meantime, could you please share your customer ID and Support PIN from your GreenGeeks account, I will collect all the info that you will need to update in cloudflare.

customer

Customer ID: 173557 Support PIN: 906697

agent

Thank you, I will review your account to gather all the needed info. Ok, let me know when you are ready, I will guide you with complete setup to reconnect emails to your hosting properly.

customer

ready!

agent

Alright, you will need to do two things: 1. Update the current setup of your MX records, and 2. Add some new DNS records 1. Update your existing MX setup. Go to your CloudFlare account and look for the DNS Setup Look for the MX record added there Turn off proxy for it by clicking on the cloud icon. Let me know once done.

customer

i dont have a cloudfare account would it have been in carrd.co?

agent

That's a possibility but I can't be sure. Do you have somebody else who manages hosting/domain for you? Also, I see the website is currently down for your domain. Is that intentional, or are you concerned about that too?

customer

no- and i have a feeling its something i changed in the greengeeks zone editor. there has never been a website activated for my domain yet i dont think, i was going to try launch one with carrd and didnt realise it would affect emails no- and i have a feeling its something i changed in the greengeeks zone editor. there has never been a website activated for my domain yet i dont think, i was going to try launch one with carrd

agent

Ok, can you please confirm what changes you had made in the zone editor? I am seeing some misconfiguration but want to be sure what you attempted to do to avoid any other issue. It looks like you may have tried to update the A record for domain. Since emails are set to follow the domain, that must have broken your email setup.

customer

i followed along the lines of chatgpt, sorry!! "to add the A record in GreenGeeks for your domain psychologywithcharlotte.com (so it connects to Carrd), use the following: ‚úÖ A Record for psychologywithcharlotte.com: Name (or Host): @ Type: A TTL: 3600 (or leave as default) IP Address (Value): 192.64.119.70 ‚úÖ Steps to Add It in GreenGeeks: Log in to GreenGeeks Account Manager Go to Hosting ‚Üí Manage for your website Under Domains, click DNS Zone Editor Choose your domain: psychologywithcharlotte.com Under the A Records section: If an A record for @ already exists, click Edit and replace the IP with 192.64.119.70 If not, click Add A Record and fill in: Name: @ TTL: 3600 Address: 192.64.119.70 Save your changes ‚è± DNS propagation can take 1‚Äì24 hours You can check progress at dnschecker.org by searching for A records for psychologywithcharlotte.com. Let me know when you're ready to add the CNAME record for www or if you want to keep email (MX) working too! Ask ChatGPT"

agent

Ok, A record IP is completely different here. But I am getting the right idea here. Let me update your email setup so that whatever you try with the domain for website, it doesn't affect emails. Please allow me a minute.

customer

thanks a million

agent

Just a heads up, in your message, chatGPT suggested to point A record for domain to 192.64.119.70, but I am seeing a different IP there. Do you want me to correct that as well?

customer

the IP chatgpt recommended was a dummy one no worries there

agent

Ah ok, I will leave it then. I have updated your MX records so they follow mail.psychologywithcharlotte.com instead of psychologywithcharlotte.com This will allow you to keep your email hosting and setup isolated from hosting setup for domain. Please allow some time for DNS propagation, 1-4 hours approx and you should see emails working again.

customer

thank you!

agent

Anytime üôÇ Let me know if you need help with anything else.

customer

all good, really appreciate how helpful youve been, hopefully smooth from here

agent

I am sure emails should be good with this. Feel free to reach out should you need further help with anything, we are here to help üôÇ Would you please rate this chat session before closing the chat window? This will help us to serve you better. Thanks for your time!!
